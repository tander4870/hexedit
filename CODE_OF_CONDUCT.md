# Code of Conduct for AI-Generated Contributions

Welcome to the Hex Editor project. Our goal is to create an innovative open source project maintained and updated exclusively through AI-generated code. To preserve this unique approach and ensure consistency, we require that **all contributions must be generated solely by AI-based tools or prompts** (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, or equivalent). Human-authored code contributions that are not the result of AI prompt outputs will not be accepted.

## Our Expectations

- **AI-Only Contributions:**  
  All code submissions, improvements, and updates must be generated exclusively by an AI tool. Contributors must ensure that the code they submit is the direct result of an AI prompt and not manually written by a human.

- **Transparency:**  
  When submitting a contribution, please include a brief statement in your pull request (or commit message) confirming that the code was generated via an AI prompt. Make sure to specify what LLM, platform or model was used. Make sure to include your specific prompts, what you asked for and what was generated. 
  
  For example:  
  > "This contribution was generated by ChatGPT following the project's AI-only guidelines."

- **Collaboration:**  
  We welcome discussions and feedback on the AI-generated output. However, any direct human-written code (or code not traceable to an AI prompt) is considered out of scope for this project and will be rejected.

  We hope and expect that contributors will honor this request! 

## Unacceptable Behavior

- **Manual Code Contributions:**  
  Submitting code that is manually written or that does not clearly document an AI-based origin is strictly prohibited.
  
- **Circumvention:**  
  Attempts to bypass the AI-only policy by mixing human-written code with AI-generated code without clear separation or disclosure will result in rejection of the contribution.

- **Undermining the Policy:**  
  Any behavior or submission that contradicts the AI-only mandate may lead to the contributor being removed from the project or barred from future contributions.

## Reporting and Enforcement

- **Reporting Violations:**  
  If you believe a submission violates the AI-only requirement, please open an issue or contact the project maintainers directly. All reports will be handled confidentially.

- **Enforcement:**  
  Contributions found to be in violation of this policy will be rejected. Repeat violations may result in further action, including removal from the list of contributors.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to maintaining an environment where AI-generated code is the standard. This approach is central to the vision of the project. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these guidelines.

If you have any questions about this policy or need clarification on whether a contribution meets the AI-only requirement, please reach out to the project maintainers.

Thank you for helping us keep this project truly AI-generated!
